# FashionIcon-Assistant

 🚀 Overview: 
 Hello! If you're reading this, you must be on the Memverge team! Hi it's Ariel and Simone! Thank you for the opportunity for us to meet and build this great project! We've learned a lot while having fun!
 
Our submission is our FashionIcon Assistant AI.  We aim to build an assistant that works alongside MemMachine and utilizes MemMachine's profile memory mechanisms and rest API to better anyone's online shopping experience.  Our trained model is created with python and other tools to give you a response based on some input you give it.   Over time, we want the AI to be programmed to find people's size, weight, color preferences etc.  There's so much to consider when shopping!

For example, if you were shopping online and placed in your weight, our model will find the right sizes for you so you can browse through the vast online fashion market easier.  Another goal is to make less of a time chunk for people.  We think this can really help people!  Additionally, you can think of our AI assistant as your own personal digital stylist outside the changing room ready to offer feedback, remember your choices, and help you find your best fit!

Shopping in person can still be done and encouraged but...how many people out there need the ultimate fashion assistant? We got it.

-Shop the Scene: 
For example: “Find me the jacket from that Dua Lipa music video.”
You upload or tag a scene from a movie or concert — the AI finds similar clothes and tells you which brands carry them now.
For example: “Find me the jacket from that Dua Lipa music video.”

💻Cyber Closet Security: uses image recognition + encryption to privately store and secure your wardrobe data which links with online shopping accounts.

⚡ 1. Outfit Generator
“Tell it: ‘Dinner with friends, 70°F, casual but cute,’ 
Input: the event, weather, and your mood.
Output: a full outfit (with accessories + shoes) generated in seconds from your wardrobe or online shops.

🧠 2. Memory-Based Wardrobe
Our AI Assitant remembers every outfit you’ve worn and when so you never repeat a look unintentionally (especially for social media or events).
“Last wore this on Sept 15 to a concert — maybe switch the jacket!”

📦3. One-Minute Packing Assistant
You need outfits for your next vacation! Type in your trip length + destination + vibe and it builds a full list of outfits for each day.
Saves hours before travel and reduces overpacking!
