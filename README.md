# FashionIcon-Assistant

 🚀 Overview: 
 
We aim to build an assistant that works alongside MemMachine and utilizes MemMachine's profile memory mechanisms and rest API to better your online shopping experience.  Our trained model is programmed to find your size, weight, color preferences etc.
For example, if you were to input your weight, our model will find the right sizes for you so you can browse through the vast online fashion market easier.  Our assistant will make online shopping also less of a time chunk for you.

Think of our AI assistant as your digital stylist outside the changing room ready to offer feedback, remember your choices, and help you find your best fit!

Shopping in person can still be done and encouraged but...how many people out there need the ultimate fashion assistant? We got it.

 
This project builds on **MemMachine**, an open-source AI memory framework by MemVerge.

🧠 2. Memory-Based Wardrobe
Our AI Assitant remembers every outfit you’ve worn and when so you never repeat a look unintentionally (especially for social media or events).
