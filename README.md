## 🚀 **Overview**

Hello MemVerge team!
We’re **Ariel and Simone**, and we’re so excited to share what we’ve built for the **MemMachine Hackathon**. Thank you for the opportunity to learn, create, and have fun along the way! 💖

Our submission is **FashionIcon Assistant**, an AI fashion companion designed to work seamlessly with **MemMachine’s profile memory system** and REST API to elevate your online shopping experience.

This assistant isn’t just smart.  It’s stylish! Over time, it learns about your **size, color preferences, body type, and fashion mood**, providing curated outfit recommendations and streamlining how you shop online.

Imagine an AI stylist who:
✨ Remembers your outfits and preferences
✨ Suggests looks for every event, mood, and weather
✨ Helps you shop smarter and save time
✨ Feels like a fashionable best friend who *always gets your vibe*

### 🧩 **Problem Statement**

Users need quick outfit ideas that adapt to **event type**, **weather**, and **mood** — all while aligning with their personal style and preferences.

### 🧠 **How MemMachine Is Being Used**

We integrated and modified Python files from the **MemMachine GitHub framework** to power our assistant.
MemMachine’s architecture allows us to:

* ⚡ **Quickly launch and test** the FastAPI backend (`app.py`)
* 🤖 **Experiment with AI features** using the OpenAI API
* 🔄 **Collaborate and debug** efficiently in an integrated environment
* 💬 **Demo chatbot responses** in real time for testing and presentations

In short, **MemMachine fuels both the development and live demo** of FashionIcon Assistant — blending AI innovation and fashion creativity in one intelligent app.
